This is a work-in-progress demo for https://cloudnativeday.ch/an-electric-automation-engine/

My plan is to either get this into a good place by September 1, 2022, or put on hold and do something else instead.
A demo based on dagger v0.2 is not the worst idea, but only if we don't mind continuing to promote Dagger & CUE.
No demo is plan C which I have no problem with if it's the most sensible choice come September.

When this is working, my intention is to move the final version into the `demos` dir, alongside `v1` & `v2`.
For now, it's rough and hacky, as expected after a few hours of work.
If we don't think that this belongs into the `demos` dir, it's also OK to keep it here.

## Pre-requisites

These tasks are currently happening in the background, and some of them involve the cloudnativeday.ch organisers.

- [x] There is an existing WP install (our local one is just for testing)
- [ ] ‚è≥ This WP install has the **wordpress-to-hugo-export** plugin already installed
- [x] There is a WP user which is able to access WP admin
- [ ] üëâ This WP user is able to make authenticated WP REST API requests
- [ ] This WP user is able to call the https://localhost:8000/wp-admin/export.php?type=hugo equivalent via the REST API
- [ ] There is an existing GitHub repository with GitHub Pages enabled - I'm thinking `gerhard/cdn`
- [ ] There is a custom FQDN pointing to this GitHub Pages install - I'm thinking `cdn.gerhard.io`

## Manual flow

Before we automate it with ~~Dagger~~ Cloak, these items are meant to test the viability of the flow.
Also: "Document, document, document" first, and then "automate, automate, automate".

- [x] Start WP locally: `docker-compose up`
- [x] Access WP site via http://localhost:8000. (If this is a fresh install, finish the setup.)
- [x] Download & install [wordpress-to-hugo-exporter](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter) plugin. Tip: [v2.0.1 zip](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.1.zip)
- [x] Download **hugo-export.zip** via https://localhost:8000/wp-admin/export.php?type=hugo
- [ ] Preview download in Hugo
- [ ] Commit & push to a repo which has GitHub Pages enabled
- [ ] Visit https://cnd.gerhard.io to see the final version

## `cloak` flow

- [x] `go install ./cmd/cloak`
- [ ] üí• `cloak generate --context ../.. -p ./examples/wp-to-hugo/cloak.yaml --output-dir . --sdk go`
```
Error: could not find : stat : no such file or directory
```

As a workaround, if I use a `cloak` binary built from the `main` branch, it doesn't panic, but it wipes the `main.go` file.

Since there there is a lot of work happening in https://github.com/dagger/cloak/pull/95 right now, I am pausing until tomorrow.

## Demo flow

TBD
